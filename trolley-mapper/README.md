# Trolley Mapper

Trolley Mapper can take customer information and dynamically place it onto the webpage, these can then be moved with click and drag to change the order they appear on the page. Extra information for the delivery vehicle can also be added which will be shown when the "Finish" button is clicked. 

The customers can also be clicked and placed onto the vehicle section if a number of trolleys have been selected on the load map.

When the map is complete the user can click the "Finish" button and there is an option to save the page as a PDF document, the title is auto completed with the name of the driver and the date selected, this allows to easy to read files if needed later. 

## Build
